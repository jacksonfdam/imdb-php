{"exp":1262329261,"data":{"plots":[{"text":"A double-bill of thrillers that recall both filmmakers' favorite exploitation films. \"Grindhouse\" (a downtown movie theater in disrepair since its glory days as a movie palace known for \"grinding out\" non-stop double-bill programs of B-movies) is presented as one full-length feature comprised of two individual films helmed separately by each director. \"Death Proof,\" is a rip-roaring slasher flick where the killer pursues his victims with a car rather than a knife, while \"Planet Terror\" shows us a view of the world in the midst of a zombie outbreak. The films are joined together by clever faux trailers that recall the '50s exploitation drive-in classics.","author":"alfiehitchie"},{"text":"An homage to exploitation B-movie thrillers that combines two feature-length segments into one double-bill designed to replicate the grind house theatergoing experience of the 70s and 80s. In \"Death Proof,\" a psycho named Stuntman Mike stalks and kills beautiful women with his car. In \"Planet Terror,\" a small-town sheriffs' department has to deal with an outbreak of murderous, infected people called \"sickos.\" A gun-legged woman named Cherry and her martial arts-wielding partner take on the zombie army. The two films will be fused together by fake movie trailers.","author":"prettypoison"}],"tconst":"tt0462322","type":"feature","title":"Grindhouse","year":"2007"}}
